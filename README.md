ExPRT (Excel速 Package of Randomization Tests): Statistical Analyses of Single-Case Intervention Data (Version 1.2, April 2014; updated October 2014)

Developed by Boris S. Gafurov and Joel R. Levin

The single-case data-analysis ExPRT (Excel速 Package of Randomization Tests), is a set of Microsoft Office 2010 Excel速-based programs for conducting randomization and permutation statistical tests in a wide variety of single-case intervention designs. The present package, developed by Boris S. Gafurov (George Mason University) and Joel R. Levin (University of Arizona and University of Wisconsin-Madison) is currently in preliminary form (Version 1.2). ExPRT is freely available to single-case researchers and consists of an extensive set of macros for: (1) generating and displaying complete randomization distributions; (2) conducting randomization statistical tests on single-case intervention data; and (3) providing outcome summaries in both graphical and numerical formats.

Any published or unpublished reports based on these programs should include specific reference to the ExPRT package and its developers.
